# 🎬 STREAMFINDER

## 📌 Project Overview
STREAMFINDER is a responsive full-stack web application designed to help users quickly find where a specific movie is available to stream. Users can search for movie titles and view streaming availability across platforms like Netflix, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Prime Video, Disney+, and more. Registered users can create a profile and save movies to a personal watchlist.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
This project uses the **MERN stack** with a balanced focus on both front-end and back-end development:

- **MongoDB**: Stores user data including profiles, favorites, and saved lists.
- **Express & Node.js**: Handles server-side logic, API integration, and user authentication.
- **React**: Powers the front-end interface for searching, filtering, and displaying results.
- **Next.js**: Manages server-side rendering and API routes.

Third-party integration:
- **Watchmode API**: Provides real-time data on movie titles and their streaming availability. [API Docs](https://api.watchmode.com/docs)

## 🎯 Project Goal
STREAMFINDER aims to eliminate the frustration of manually checking multiple streaming platforms to find a specific movie. Whether you're winding down on a Friday night or planning a movie marathon, this app streamlines the search process by aggregating streaming data and helping users determine if they already subscribe to the service offering the movie.

## 👥 Target Users
The application is designed for:
- Movie lovers and frequent streamers
- Users subscribed to multiple streaming services
- Anyone who enjoys organizing and tracking their movie watchlist
